# Product Brief: One Down

## Executive Summary

**One Down** is a task management app designed to eliminate the ambient anxiety of trailing todos. Unlike traditional todo apps that show endless lists and expect users to do the cognitive work of prioritization, One Down presents **one actionable task at a time** — the right task, at the right moment, with the right context.

Built for the ADHD brain but designed for everyone, One Down acts as a **reliable task caretaker** that surfaces tasks only when they can be acted upon, breaks down overwhelming items into achievable first steps, and makes task completion feel satisfying rather than stressful.

The core philosophy: **The app does the worrying, so you don't have to.**

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Traditional todo apps amplify anxiety instead of reducing it. They present endless scrolling lists, expect users to manually prioritize, and send nagging notifications that create guilt rather than action. The result: users avoid opening the app entirely, tasks slip through the cracks, and the mental burden of remembering what needs to be done remains constant.

The specific pain point: **trailing tasks that create ambient anxiety**. Returning packages, renewing passports, prepping for conferences — tasks that aren't urgent *right now* but will become critical if forgotten. Users expend significant mental energy worrying about these tasks, avoiding them because they don't feel immediately critical, then suffering when something slips through.

### Problem Impact

- **Constant low-grade anxiety**: The nagging feeling that something has been forgotten
- **Decision fatigue**: Opening a todo app means facing "what should I do first?" every time
- **Avoidance spiral**: Todo apps become stressful to open, leading to more avoidance
- **Missed deadlines**: Important but non-urgent tasks slip until they become crises
- **Mental load tax**: Significant cognitive energy spent worrying instead of doing

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Gap | What Existing Apps Do | What Users Need |
|-----|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Information overload** | Show everything at once | Show one achievable task at a time |
| **No context awareness** | Treat all tasks equally regardless of situation | Filter by what's actionable *right now* (location, resources, energy) |
| **Nagging notifications** | Remind at scheduled times regardless of context | Notify only when actionable, using challenge/novelty instead of guilt |
| **High setup friction** | Require extensive categorization and configuration | Work immediately from a brain dump with minimal setup |
| **No prioritization intelligence** | Expect users to manually decide what's important | Smart AI-powered prioritization that surfaces the right task at the right time |

### Proposed Solution

One Down reimagines task management around a single principle: **reduce cognitive load at every step**.

**Core Experience:**
1. **Brain dump capture** — Voice or text, minimal friction, AI organizes
2. **Context selection** — Tap where you are / what you have available
3. **One card appears** — The single best task you can do right now
4. **Complete, skip, or release** — Simple actions, satisfying feedback
5. **Never worry** — The app tracks deadlines, surfaces urgency at the right time, handles the mental load

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Smart Prioritization**: AI-powered task sequencing based on urgency, context, and user patterns
- **Quick Wins / Big Time Modes**: Start with easy momentum-builders or tackle challenging items when ready
- **AI Task Breakdown**: Large tasks auto-decomposed into achievable first steps
- **Contextual Filtering**: Show only tasks doable with current resources (home/office/laptop/phone)
- **Deadline Intelligence**: Surfaces time-sensitive tasks at the optimal moment — not too early, not too late
- **"Cut it Loose" Support**: Explicitly supports releasing tasks that no longer serve you — liberation, not failure

### Key Differentiators

| Differentiator | What It Means |
|----------------|---------------|
| **One-Card Focus** | UI literally shows one task — decision fatigue eliminated at the design level |
| **Task Caretaker Philosophy** | The app worries so you don't; surfaces tasks only when actionable |
| **Themeless Gamification** | Satisfying, rewarding experience without RPG/forest/fantasy themes — universal appeal |
| **Ultra-Low Pricing** | ~£1.50/month — so cheap it feels silly NOT to pay |
| **ADHD-First Design** | Built on evidence-based strategies (task breakdown, dopamine rewards, low-effort flow) |
| **Zero-Friction Onboarding** | Works from first task; brain dump to organized list instantly |
| **Challenge Notifications** | Never nags — uses novelty, challenge, or urgency framing instead |

**In one sentence:** *One Down is the todo app that manages your trailing tasks for you, shows you one thing at a time, and makes getting things done feel almost accidental.*

## Target Users

### Primary User: The Trailing Task Avoider

**Archetype:** Alex, 31, freelance designer

**Context:** Juggles multiple client projects, personal admin (bills, returns, appointments), and a side business. Lives with ADHD (diagnosed or suspected). Uses iPhone and MacBook. Gets bursts of productivity or boredom throughout the day and wants to capitalize on them.

**Day-to-day:**
- Opens existing todo app, sees 40+ tasks, feels instant dread, closes app
- Spends mental energy *remembering* things rather than *doing* them
- The passport renewal has been on the list for 4 months
- Actually productive when someone gives them ONE clear thing to do
- Picks up tasks when they get a burst of energy or boredom — wants the app to show the *best* task for what they have right now

**Current tools (and why they fail):**
- Apple Reminders: Too basic, no prioritization
- Todoist: Overwhelming list view, notifications feel like nagging
- Paper lists: Loses them, no smart filtering
- Nothing: Just tries to remember (badly)

**What success looks like:**
- Opens app without dread
- Sees one task that makes sense for *right now* given context, urgency, and energy
- Can take a first step on big tasks without facing the whole mountain
- Actually completes the "trailing" tasks that haunt them
- Feels *lighter* — less ambient anxiety
- Says: "I forgot this app was doing the thinking for me"

### Secondary User: The Overloaded Professional

**Archetype:** Sam, 38, product manager

**Context:** Neurotypical but stretched thin across work, family, and personal admin. Work tasks are tracked in Jira and Outlook; *life* tasks slip through. Needs executive function assistance without the clinical framing.

**Pain point:** Work is organized; personal life is chaos. Bills, errands, family commitments — none of it fits in work tools.

**What they want:** A trustworthy place to dump personal todos that doesn't require maintenance. Something that handles the thinking so they can just *do*.

### Tertiary Users (Potential)

- **Students**: Managing coursework, deadlines, part-time work, and social commitments
- **Parents**: Juggling family logistics, school events, household management alongside personal goals
- **Anyone with executive function struggles**: Depression, burnout, chronic illness — conditions that make "just make a list" insufficient

## Success Metrics

### Core Success Signal

**The app is working if users keep coming back without forcing themselves.**

Unlike most todo apps where novelty wears off after 2-3 weeks, One Down succeeds when users open it 2+ times per week, month after month, because it genuinely reduces their stress and helps them get things done.

### User Success Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Initial Benchmark |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Weekly Active Users (WAU) retention** | % of users still active after 30/60/90 days | 60% at 30 days, 40% at 90 days |
| **Tasks resolved** | Tasks completed OR mindfully cut loose (not lingering) | Resolve > 70% within 60 days |
| **Time-to-task-start** | Seconds from app open to starting/engaging a task | < 30 seconds median |
| **Deadline success rate** | Tasks with deadlines completed on time | > 80% on-time |
| **User sentiment** | Users report feeling less stressed, more in control | Qualitative via in-app feedback prompts |

### Business Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Initial Benchmark |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Free → Paid conversion** | % of users who subscribe (at ~£1.50/mo) | 10-15% (stretch: 20%) |
| **Monthly churn** | % of subscribers who cancel | < 5% |
| **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** | Would users recommend? | > 50 |

### What We're NOT Measuring (Yet)

- Raw DAU (vanity metric unless compared to WAU)
- Total tasks created (more tasks ≠ better)
- Session length (longer ≠ better for a task app)

### Measurement Philosophy

These benchmarks are starting points, not predictions. Adjust based on real usage data. The goal is to have *something* to track from day one, then iterate based on what we learn.

### Monetization Model

**TBD — to be explored during development and dogfooding.**

Principles:
- No paywall on first open — users must experience value before being asked to pay
- Ultra-low monthly pricing (~£1.50/mo) to maximize conversion
- Free tier should be functional, not crippled — premium unlocks advanced features
- Avoid "locked out" aesthetic — premium features visible but tastefully gated
- Free trial via Google Play/App Store subscription mechanics
